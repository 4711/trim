# TRIM

Work in progress. Under active decelopment. Pull requests welcome.

## Wut

Running a simple dev environment and readying assets for production should
be super easy and trivial. This is an attempt at a basic template for
faster performing websites. Performance matters, but we shouldn't have
to constantly pick low-hanging fruit. It should be push-button. This is that button.

# Getting started

    git clone git@github:mrmrs/trim.git; cd trim; npm install

### To run the development environment
    gulp

### To minify assets for production

    gulp production

## TODO

- Add image optimization
- Concat and minify all css/js files
- Csslint & JShint integration
- Integrate autoprefixer
- Integrate Livereload / server port
